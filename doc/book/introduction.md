# Introduction

## What is this book about?

This book is not about the theory behind operating systems, or how any specific
OS works. For the first we recommend Modern Operating Systems by Andrew
Tanenbaum [@ostanenbaum]. For the second the internet is your friend.

This book is a practical guide to writing your own operating system.
It is designed to not give too much away with samples and code excerpts, but
still give enough help with the technical details.

We've tried to collect parts of the vast (and often excellent) expanse of
expanse of  material and tutorials out there, on the web and otherwise, and add
our own insights into the problems we encountered and struggled with.

TODO: "Links to interesting material are available for deeper reading."

## The reader

TODO: should be comfortable with UNIX/Linux, and with "systems programming".

## Credits, thanks and acknowledgements

We'd like to thank the OSDev community for their great wiki and helpful
members, and James Molloy for his eminent kernel development tutorial. We'd
also like to thank our supervisor Torbj√∂rn Granlund for his insightful
questions and our interesting discussions.

TODO: perhaps "number munchers".

Most of the CSS formatting of the book is based on the work by Scott Chacon for
