<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Intel intended x86 programmers to think of every memory item as
being contained in a segment, a logically-contiguous, bounds-checked,
typed memory region.  So the processor thinks of instruction addresses
being in a code segment, stack addresses as being in a stack segment,
and data addresses as being in one of four data segments.  This
thinking pervades the hardware, so before you can disable it you
must understand it to some extent.</p>

<h2>Summary for Managers</h2>

<p>When the processor fetches an instruction, it asks
for an address of the form CS:EIP.  So if %EIP is
0x100, this indicates the 256'th byte of the CS
segment.</p>

<p>In order to figure out what that means,
the processor looks at the 16-bit segment <em>selector</em>
which was placed in the %CS register by the operating
system.  Segment selectors contain three pieces of
information: a segment number, a table selector flag,
and a request privilege level.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="segments_files/segsel.gif"></p>

The segment number indexes a segment <em>descriptor</em> table
which is much like the interrupt descriptor table. There are
two tables of segment descriptors, the <em>global descriptor
table</em> and the <em>local descriptor table</em>. The table
indexed by the segment number depends on the table selector flag.
Finally, the request privilege level (RPL) has different meanings
depending on which segment register the selector is in. In this 
case (the %CS register), the RPL sets the privilege level
of the processor.<p></p>

<p>Each segment <em>descriptor</em> defines a region of <em>virtual</em> memory
by specifying a base address and a size.  In addition,
there are various flag bits and a privilege level.
The 0x100 is compared to the segment size (it must
be smaller or else the address is outside the CS segment!)
and then added to the base address to form a "linear"
virtual address, which could be something like
0xCAFE0100 if the segment base were 0xCAFE0000.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="segments_files/segdesc.gif"></p>

<p>This linear virtual address is then fed into the
page-directory/page-table system based on the
active page directory, determined by the value
placed in the %CR3 register by the operating system.
That is, the top 10 bits are used to look up a page
table in the page directory, and the next 10 bits
are used to look up a page table entry inside the page
table.</p>

<p>Stack addresses work the same way as code addresses
but are defined to use addresses
inside the SS segment (that is, the segment specified by the selector
stored in the SS register).  Data reads and writes are defined to
use the DS segment by default but can use the ES, FS, or GS segments
instead.</p>

<h2>What this means to you</h2>

<p>In these projects, we will be using segmentation as little as
possible. Often segmentation is used to increase protection and
robustness. In order to simplify the kernel however we will not be
using segmentation to achieve these goals. Unfortunately we must
still use segmentation in some limited degree to satisfy the x86
architecture's requirements. This document summarizes segmentation
as far as the x86 is concerned. Note that you do NOT have to
understand how to modify things like the global descriptor table.
You simply need to understand what segment selectors need to be in
what segment registers when (and what a segment register and selector
is).</p>

<h2>How we abuse segmentation</h2>

<p>All segments we define will have base 0x00000000 and 0xFFFFFFFF.
To see why this makes sense, recall that we want a totally flat
address space, and that the processor uses the base and limit
as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>check offset &lt; limit (so we set limit == infinity)
</li><li>add base to offset (so we set base to 0)
</li></ol>

<p>The net result is that the processor mindlessly verifies that
our offset (say, a value of %EIP) is less than infinity, and then
adds zero to it.  This is an expensive no-op, but, hey, we have
more transistors than we know what to do with, right?  So,
naively, one 0x00000000-base, 0xFFFFFFFF-limit segment descriptor,
pointed to by one segment selector, placed in %CS, %SS, %DS, %ES,
%FS, and %GS, should suffice, right?</p>

<h2>We need two segments, one for code and one for data</h2>

It turns out that while the segment descriptor TYPE field allows
us to specify a wide variety of segment permissions, there is no
bit pattern which grants both EXEC and READ/WRITE permissions.
Thus we need one READ,EXEC segment for code and one READ,WRITE
segment for data and stack.  So we will need two segment
descriptors and two segment selectors, one for %CS and one for
%SS, %DS, %ES, %FS, and %GS.

<h2>We need four segments, two at PL0 and two at PL3</h2>

<p>At any given time, the CPU is executing at one of four privilege
levels. The privilege levels are organized something like this
(this diagram is taken right out of intel-sys.pdf, chapter 4,
section 5):</p>

<center><img src="segments_files/priv.gif"></center><p>

</p><p>In these projects (as is the case with many operating systems),
only privilege levels 0 and 3 will be used. Privilege level 0 (PL0)
corresponds to kernel mode, while privilege level 3 (PL3) corresponds
to user mode. The privilege level of the currently executing process
is stored in the bottom two bits (the RPL) of the segment selectors
in the %CS and %SS registers (this implies that those two bit fields must
be the same). In a data segment selector, the RPL has a different 
function. When performing privilege level checks to see if a particular
segment is accessible as a data segment, the processor must decide
what the current privilege level is, and if that level is privileged
enough to access the data segment. If the RPL of a data segment selector
is less privileged than the current privilege level, the processor
uses that less priviliged level in determining if the data segment
is accessible.</p>

<h3>Protecting the Kernel</h3>

<p>We would naturally like to protect the kernel from being tampered
with by meddling user processes. We could use segmentation to do
this, but because we are trying to avoid segmentation, we will use
the paging mechanism. Each page table entry has a bit for
user/supervisor. This bit controls whether the page is accessible
from user mode (PL3). Note that there is also a similar bit in the
page directory entry. These two bits combine to specify the overall
access characteristics of the page.</p>

<p>So, in order to use paging to protect the kernel area, that means
that our user processes will have to execute in user mode (PL3).
This might be obvious to some, but it is important to conciously
realize the reasons why we do not just run all the code, kernel
and user, in kernel mode (PL0) or run all the code in user mode
(PL3). In order to have all memory accesses checked by the hardware
automatically, we need to make use of the privilege level mechanism
(and either segmentation or paging - in our case, paging).</p>

<p>So now, we've established that we have to have two separate
privilege levels in the system. The kernel will run at privilege
level 0, and the user processes will run at privilege level 3.</p>

<h2>Four descriptors and four selectors</h2>

<p>In summary, our interaction with segmentation will be defining
four very-similar segment descriptors (same base, same limit;
type PL values and 2 TYPE values).  At any time every segment
register should contain one of these four segment selectors.</p>

<h2>Putting the pieces together</h2>

<p>When <code>kernel_main()</code> begins, segment descriptors for
all four segments have been entered into the Global Descriptor Table
for you.  Your job will be to make sure the appropriate selectors
make it into the right segment registers at the right times.</p>
<!-- BEGIN COMMENTED-OUT SECTION -->

<!-- END COMMENTED-OUT SECTION -->

<p>The code and stack segment registers are changed automatically when
you take an interrupt or exception. This happens because when you set
up your interrupt and exception handlers in the IDT, you specified
that they were DPL 0. This means the handlers need to be executed at
privilege level zero. You also specified that the code segment was
SEGSEL_KERNEL_CS. The stack switches automatically to a value defined in
the hardware task OSKit has set up (this is similar to the value set
by the <tt>set_esp0</tt> function).  However, the hardware does
<b>not</b> automatically change the various data segment registers.
You should determine which ones you will need while in the kernel,
save their user-mode values somewhere, and install the correct values
for the kernel. While the kernel can use PL3 (user level) data
segments since they are less privileged, your kernel should not rely
on the data segment registers being properly set at an exception or
interrupt (the user process may have clobbered the data segment
registers).</p>

<p>To switch into user mode (PL3), you will set up an <tt>iret</tt>
block that contains, among other things, a stack segment selector
and a code segment selector.  Before you <tt>iret</tt> to user mode
the first time during process bootstrap, remember you need to
install segment selectors into the data segment registers as well.
You can use the same segment selector that you put into the stack
segment register, SEGSEL_USER_DS.  Finally, you need to remember
to save and restore those data segment registers along with the
rest of the process' context on a context switch. Once you have
bootstrapped a new process, its code and stack segment selectors
will be saved automatically by the interrupt mechanism (look at
the iret block, the CS and SS values are saved in there). However
the data segment registers are not saved. These could be changed
while you are in kernel mode to point to segments requiring PL0 to
access. If you resumed executing a user process with that, the
first time it attempted a memory access it would receive a general
protection fault. So, make sure to save and restore those data
segment registers.</p>
